desribe the Kruskal's algorithm in constructing a minimum spanning tree (Generated by co-pilot lol)

Time Complexity: O(Eâ‹…logE). Here, E represents the number of edges.
Space Complexity: O(V). Here, V represents the number of vertices.

1. Sort the edges in ascending order of their weight.

2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree
   constructed so far. If cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it.

3. Repeat step#2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.

4. The added edges make up the minimum spanning tree.
